# k_shot-GAN-synthetic-data

Improving the generation of synthetic data in LLMs using k-shot prompting and a GAN.

Sentiment analysis is an important tool for businesses and governments that helps them better understand public opinions, allowing them to make decisions based on trends. A commonly used approach to sentiment analysis utilizes CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) which typically perform best when given large datasets. However, acquiring this data may be difficult to obtain and time-consuming. In order to address these problems, we present a new approach involving combining GANs and k-shot prompting for synthetic data generation using the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model, along with a two-step filtering process to select the highest quality samples.
